## Project Expertise (Mulch)
<!-- mulch-onboard-v:3 -->

This project uses [Mulch](https://github.com/jayminwest/mulch) for structured expertise management.

**At the start of every session**, run:
```bash
ml prime
```

Injects project-specific conventions, patterns, decisions, failures, references, and guides into
your context. Run `ml prime --files src/foo.ts` before editing a file to load only records
relevant to that path (per-file framing, classification age, and confirmation scores included).

For monolith projects where dumping every record wastes context, set
`prime.default_mode: manifest` in `.mulch/mulch.config.yaml` (or pass `--manifest`) to emit a
quick reference + domain index. Agents then scope-load with `ml prime <domain>` or
`ml prime --files <path>`.

**Before completing your task**, record insights worth preserving — conventions discovered,
patterns applied, failures encountered, or decisions made:
```bash
ml record <domain> --type <convention|pattern|failure|decision|reference|guide> --description "..."
```

Evidence auto-populates from git (current commit + changed files). Link explicitly with
`--evidence-seeds <id>` / `--evidence-gh <id>` / `--evidence-linear <id>` / `--evidence-bead <id>`,
`--evidence-commit <sha>`, or `--relates-to <mx-id>`. Upserts of named records merge outcomes
instead of replacing them; validation failures print a copy-paste retry hint with missing fields
pre-filled.

Run `ml status` for domain health, `ml doctor` to check record integrity (add `--fix` to strip
broken file anchors), `ml --help` for the full command list. Write commands use file locking and
atomic writes, so multiple agents can record concurrently. Expertise survives `git worktree`
cleanup — `.mulch/` resolves to the main repo.

### Before You Finish

1. Discover what to record (shows changed files and suggests domains):
   ```bash
   ml learn
   ```
2. Store insights from this work session:
   ```bash
   ml record <domain> --type <convention|pattern|failure|decision|reference|guide> --description "..."
   ```
3. Validate and commit:
   ```bash
   ml sync
   ```

## Issue Tracking (Seeds)
<!-- seeds-onboard-v:1 -->

This project uses [Seeds](https://github.com/jayminwest/seeds) for git-native issue tracking.

**At the start of every session**, run:
```
sd prime
```

This injects session context: rules, command reference, and workflows.

**Quick reference:**
- `sd ready` — Find unblocked work
- `sd create --title "..." --type task --priority 2` — Create issue
- `sd update <id> --status in_progress` — Claim work
- `sd close <id>` — Complete work
- `sd dep add <id> <depends-on>` — Add dependency between issues
- `sd sync` — Sync with git (run before pushing)

### Before You Finish
1. Close completed issues: `sd close <id>`
2. File issues for remaining work: `sd create --title "..."`
3. Sync and push: `sd sync && git push`

## Prompt Management (Canopy)
<!-- canopy-onboard-v:1 -->

This project uses [Canopy](https://github.com/jayminwest/canopy) for git-native prompt management.

**At the start of every session**, run:
```
cn prime
```

This injects prompt workflow context: commands, conventions, and common workflows.

**Quick reference:**
- `cn list` — List all prompts
- `cn render <name>` — View rendered prompt (resolves inheritance)
- `cn emit --all` — Render prompts to files
- `cn update <name>` — Update a prompt (creates new version)
- `cn sync` — Stage and commit .canopy/ changes

**Do not manually edit emitted files.** Use `cn update` to modify prompts, then `cn emit` to regenerate.
